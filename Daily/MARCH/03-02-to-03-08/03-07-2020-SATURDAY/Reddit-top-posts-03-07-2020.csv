YSK having a garbage bin in your guest bathroom can save your female visitors from a lot of discomfort.,36064,YouShouldKnow,1797,1583571972.0,I have noticed that many of my male friends who are either gay or single don't have garbage bins in their half bathrooms. This can make it very awkward for a female on their period. Either they have to try and wrap up feminine hygiene products in toilet paper and carry it around your house searching for another garbage or awkwardly stash it in their purse. It's 20 times more awkward if this happens during a party when you have a lot of people around. I've also had this problem before when visiting older women who don't need a garbage can for their own personal use anymore so men aren't the only culprits. So please consider that your guests might actually need and appreciate a small garbage can in the toilet area.,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/fenmr2/ysk_having_a_garbage_bin_in_your_guest_bathroom/,2020-03-07 03:06:12

TIFU I had the most embarrassing booty call ever.,25757,tifu,1358,1583587070.0,"Tonight‚Äôs booty call went horribly wrong. 

Horribly. 

Horribly. 

Wrong. 

After almost a year of separation, my divorce was finalized this week. And what a better way to celebrate, than with a good old fashioned booty call. 

I had recently reconnected with a man I had previously had some playtime with. The last time we were together, I had what was probably the best sex of my life. So to say I was excited to be talking with him again was an understatement. 

After some basic chat, we made plans to meet up tonight. This next tidbit may seem like TMI, but it‚Äôs important to the story. My IUD does not play nice and more often than not I‚Äôm bleeding to some extent. Tonight included. But he was fine with that, so we kept our plans. 

He comes over, and things instantly get heated. More MIND BLOWING sex commences. Hot, steamy, sheet soaking sex. We take some time to recharge and go for round 2. Not as hot and steamy, but still damn good. I lay down next to him, but under the covers. He gets up and starts getting dressed. We have some small talk, and then he walks over to my side of the bed and looks at the floor. 

‚ÄúWhat is THAT?‚Äù He says. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I look over the edge of the bed. There are two dark spots on the floor. ‚ÄúEh. I‚Äôll clean it up‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know what this is, right?‚Äù He asks. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs...‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not blood‚Äù he interrupts. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not red.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat??‚Äù

Again, he says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not blood. That‚Äôs BROWN. You know what that is.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I stammer. ‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt be. I would have known if that happened.‚Äù 


He just starts laughing, DOUBLE CHECKS HIS SOCKS, and heads down my stairs, and out the door. 

Y‚Äôall. I came so hard, I pooped. Somehow, during  round 1, my body was contracting so intensely, I actually dropped two small turds. And since my ass was off the edge of the bed, they landed on my bedroom floor without either of us noticing. In my defense, I had just finished a round of augmentin a few days prior, and my stomach is still readjusting. 

Pretty sure he‚Äôs already deleted my contact info. He‚Äôs given me the best sex of my life, and it‚Äôs most likely never happening again.

TL;DR: I pooped during some of the best sex of my life. He took off as soon as we realized what happened. Bye amazing sex.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/feqmpx/tifu_i_had_the_most_embarrassing_booty_call_ever/,2020-03-07 07:17:50

It is very clear why Samuel was not accepted. Our income is able to cover the tuition in full and you informed us yesterday that there was no waitlist for the Spanish immersion program. In fact, you seemed eager to schedule a meeting to discuss the next steps towards enrollment. My family was rejected because, as you stated yesterday, our ‚Äúvalues‚Äù do not align with those of Northepointe Christian. Although I grew up in the evangelical church as the child of a pastor, I made the decision to leave Christianity due to the closed minded, false love that I witnessed first hand. Despite my trepidation to schedule a tour with your institution, I challenged myself to put aside my own experiences for the benefit of my child. Sadly, I see now that not much has changed. Thank you and Northepointe for confirming and validating my decision to leave Christianity behind.‚Äù",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/femag3/so_proud_of_my_wifes_response_to_an_email_from_a/,2020-03-07 01:25:54

I had to make sure to buy extra because people are clearing the store out, so I don't run out. I don't know what the purpose of stockpiling either of these things are, but it's annoying. It reminds me of the ""gas scare"" here in San Antonio right after that hurricane hit Houston. I wasn't worried, but when everyone else got worried, I was forced to find gas just because everyone was freaked out, no stations had gas, and I was running on almost empty thinking everyone was dumb. Drove a few miles out of the city, surprise! No gas shortage. I went to pick up a friend from the Houston airport a few days later. All the stations I saw there had gas, no one was freaked out.

Girls who think every man is flirting with them are annoying,12397,unpopularopinion,968,1583613532.0,"THIS APPLIES TO BOTH GENDERS
The title says it all. No Rebecca, just because your teacher asked you to hand him over the papers next to you he isnt flirting with you. Just because the barista at starbucks is nice to you he is not trying to pick you up. I understand women get hit on by a lot of  creeps, but most of the time its not really the case.
Being nice to somebody doesnt mean you have a crush on them, its just human decency.

Edit: the title is wrong, i figured. This applies to both genders. It happens a lot with young girls getting hit on by other men too, like in restaurants, or just in the streets. Just because somebody is nice to you they are not flirting. BUT! If your partner is constanly flirting with other people, and making really ovious statements about them being hotter than you, and them wanting to leave you, your consern is probably reasonable.

My final statement is that people are nice, but dont take advantage of them, and if your partner is constantly flirting with other people its an issue, and you have every right to be angry.

Edit 2: i made this post, thinking it will get like 20 upvotes and thats it. I didnt think it will blow up, so all the people commenting its not an unpopular opinion, thanks i noticed.

Because r/gamersriseup just got banned,8061,copypasta,419,1583564957.0,"They targeted gamers.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/fem21i/because_rgamersriseup_just_got_banned/,2020-03-07 01:09:17
My dog protected me today.,10352,TwoXChromosomes,348,1583626114.0,"I live in a city with my 9 month old golden retriever puppy [(puppy tax)](https://imgur.com/a/alWT6y8). He's the sweetest boy and loves every dog and person he sees on the street and in the park.  

I was walking back from the dog park with my happy puppy and an older man on a bike yelled across the street that he was cute, I laughed and said thank you. Par for the course with my dog - I'm sure you can see why. The man then took this as an invitation to bicycle over to me, and stop right next to me.  

He began to ask me questions and the encounter went from pleasant to irritating. ""How old are you, are you in school? What's your puppy's name?""  

I told him my boyfriend was in med school and waiting for me (he is actually out of the country, so not true), and to have a nice day, and he proceeded to go ""mannnnnnn...everyone has a boyfriend..."" and bicycle next to me down the path back to my apartment, as I was clearly walking away from him and he had been going the other way.  

My pup then turns to him and starts snarling, and barking, an absolute first for him. His hackles are raised, and he starts jumping towards the man on his bike a bit. The creep gets all nervous, saying stuff like ""woah, woah woah, why are you acting like this puppy?"" and finally stops cycling and lets me walk back alone. Of course, he still yelled out ""WANNA FUCK?"" across the parking lot.  

I had no problem telling this guy to fuck off, but I am just happy to know that my puppy has my back just in case :)",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/fex567/my_dog_protected_me_today/,2020-03-07 18:08:34

Sister: ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll make it official soon. We just started talking. Yeah! I‚Äôm thinking of x, y, and z schools for art!‚Äù

The monster was sentenced to 20 years without parole and possibly another 20 after. This allows her a future. She can go to college if she chooses without fear of him around her. She has 20 years of not looking over her shoulder. I am so proud of her. 

She‚Äôs going to make it!  She‚Äôs so strong. She did it.


Thank you for your kindness and internet support. It truly means a lot. I‚Äôve been messaged a bunch too. To answer the most concerned, yes She‚Äôs in counseling and will continue that for as long as she needs and wants. Maybe a bit longer after that too.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fepvb9/my_daughter_was_raped_at_14/,2020-03-07 06:09:19
