I looked and I saw myself and I actually thought, ""hey I don't look too bad."" I know this isn't much but I've been struggling with my mental health and self image lately, so to look in the mirror at myself and, despite all my scars and imperfections, actually think that I look kinda good, was honestly just amazing and I surprised myself. I know it's not a big deal but it meant a lot to me and just thought I'd share. carry on and have a nice day.

edit: holy crap guys I didn't expect this to kinda blow up like it did but I appreciate it so much! it's great to know how amazing and wholesome this community is!

Confidence is accepting that you are not good looking not convincing yourself you are,16271,unpopularopinion,836,1583695573.0,"Just watched a random youtube video featuring every one being asked to rate their own physical appearance and was surprised to see so many below average or borderline ugly looking people rating themselves 10.

So I scroll through the comment section and I see every one praising them for it because ""if you feel like a 10,you are a 10""...like what?

So I can just go to a Hollywood acting agent or modeling agency and just say ""I say I'm a 10 therefore I am so cast me next to Brad Pitt in your next movie even though I am an average looking guy realistically""

It is bullshit and illustrates the problem many people have and everyone propagating it and that is that you can't be confident if you are ugly or better put consider yourself ugly.
Confidence is accepting your flaws and seeing your values in spite of your flaws not covering them up with your delusions.

Saying you are a 10 ( perfect,flawless, best model on the planet ) looking person when you are all but that is the opposite of what you should do if you are searching for true confidence.

Accept your appearance realistically without downplaying or deluding yourself and DON'T EQUATE LOOKS with confidence.

A confident person is the one that sees his/her value not in terms of looks but personal strengths and virtues known only to him/herself.

If you feel the need to convince yourself you are a ""10"" in order to be confident it doesn't make you confident it makes you delusional and insecure.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ffbbh3/confidence_is_accepting_that_you_are_not_good/,2020-03-08 13:26:13

"“I need to be nicer to the interns? Okay, enjoy your fight with the FDA!”",11171,MaliciousCompliance,294,1583647724.0,"This is my dads story, not mine, so I won’t be including any dialogue. I’m also going to have to be a bit vague in places to protect said job. Info tidbit, for those somehow unfamiliar, the FDA is the American regulatory body that approves medical stuff for sale on the market, along with being the oversight body of the entire food industry in the US. It’s a big, clunky, slightly outdated, and often frustrating agency but it’s there for an incredibly good reason- to keep corporations from maiming or killing anyone. 

My dad has been an engineer, and a damned good one, with his company for 29 years. He holds over 60 patents for them with another couple hundred patents in various stages of processing. He holds a job title only held by less than 1% of the engineers at his firm. Like I said, he’s a damn good engineer. 

My dads company uses a lot of interns from all over the country (and sometimes the world), all of whom are desperate to learn at such a well respected firm. They are paid generously (up to $25/hr) and aren’t overworked (they almost never do overtime). But over the last 10 years or so, many schools have tweaked their engineering degree programs and are now leaving out emphasis on several things that are vital to success at said firm. As a result, my dad can be a bit tough on his interns. To clarify, he’s never mean, doesn’t raise his voice, doesn’t cuss, etc- but he will make them redo lab tests and reports until they’re done correctly. This is vital as everything the company makes must be approved by the FDA before it can go to market and that process can be horrendous. 

A few years ago, my dad got assigned a quite lazy intern and things were tense for the 5 months he was there. When the intern left, he told them my dad was much too firm with him and “needs to learn to relax!” They decided to use this an excuse to not pay my dad his entire (rather robust) bonus that year... until someone in the meeting stood up in support of my dad. This guy was a low level manager, still on the young side, who was there to learn about the review process. He had also interned under my dad years earlier. This young manager told them the only reason he is where he is today is because my dad was tough on him. He learned how to do things right and do it right the first time. He told the reviewers they were nuts and it’d be better if more intern supervisors were hard on the interns. 

My dad got his bonus that year... but the next year, they pulled out the same bullshit and cut his bonus in half. No one stopped it that time. So my dad said fuck it, he’ll do exactly what they want. Best of all, the interned he’d just been assigned was on the lazy side. 

Several months later, my dad was called into a meeting. They told him a project had been denied FDA clearance, costing them over $500,000, because of sloppy work from my dads intern. My dad wasn’t actually in this failed project, his intern had been loaned to another team for it, but my dad was still this kids supervisor and the one double checking the reports. My dad coldly informed them that he was only doing what they asked him to do. He was being nicer to the intern, allowing them to turn in lab reports they generated instead of making the kid rewrite it over until it was correct. 

Needless to say, my dad got his bonus this year and there were no more mentions of interns and lab reports.

Edit- I’ve seen a ton of comments about quality control. I cut that bit from the initial story to shorten it, but apparently that’s a hang up for people. They had a robust quality system. Note the “had”. The place was between two massive rounds of layoffs when this went down and it showed. Systems hadn’t been properly reconnected, people who were unprepared to be the engineering head of a team suddenly were, etc. It was such a mess top to bottom that they had guys volunteer to walk during the next round of layoffs- they weren’t willing to deal with the fallout a second time. Thankfully the second round of layoffs was over a year ago and things have finally stabilized and are returning to normal but this was far from the only really dumb mistake that happened during that time.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/ff2gca/i_need_to_be_nicer_to_the_interns_okay_enjoy_your/,2020-03-08 00:08:44

Neighbors tried to label me a prostitute because I was sexually active,11053,entitledparents,472,1583687479.0,"I lived in Melbourne, Australia for a bout a year (2013 to 2014). There, I met a gorgeous same sex couple - Brian and Derek ( name changed ).  They were both bisexual. They lived in the same building as me on the floor directly above mine. I soon entered into a sexual relationship with both of them. We would have threesomes, and sometimes gangbangs. Besides the awesome sex, I also became really good friends with them and we're still in touch. It was tons of fun for all involved. 

&#x200B;

Among my  neighbors, were a middle aged couple with two children. They lived right across the hallway from me and were quick to judge us after seeing Brian and Derek exiting my apartment early in the morning on more than one occasion. The woman, Karen asked me in the elevator what I was doing with ""those two gays"". I politely told her it was none of her business. When she kept on pestering me, I told her ""If you must know, I'm friends with benefits with them, now leave me alone"". I still remember the look of shock on her face. I don't think she expected me to reply so brazenly.

&#x200B;

 When I told Brian and Derek about this, they shared their own experience in dealing with them. This couple was rather homophobic too and had tried to talk to the property manager about ""the fags moving into a building with families and children"". They were told to fuck off (just not in so many words), but anytime either, or both of these guys were in the elevator with them, or ran into them in the parking lot, the husband (Let's call him Todd) would stand between them and his kids while giving Brian and/or Derek angry looks. Must've been trying to prevent their kids form catching ""the gay"". LOL

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the weeks that followed, the entitled couple continued to give me the stink eye any time they saw me. I just smiled back at them sweetly, which  pissed them off even more. On one occasion, their teenage daughter said ""good morning"" to me and tried to make small talk, before her mother dragged her away by the arm, while berating her for talking to ""that woman"". Interestingly, their kids seemed very well behaved and nice and I truly felt sorry for them. 

&#x200B;

My next door neighbors (another couple with kids with whom I got along very well) later told me that EM had tried to get them to file a noise complaint against me. According to EM's logic, since I shared a wall with that family, they could probably hear all the ""ungodly"" noises coming from my apartment and they should complain in order to protect their children. The nice couple told them they would do no such thing as I had never bothered them and they had never heard any such noises coming out of my apartment.

&#x200B;

One night, Brian Derek and I decided to have a foursome that would involve the three of us and Brian and Derek's friend Dean. The next morning, Dean asked if he could come back to my place with me. As it was a Sunday morning and Dean was hotter than hell, I agreed. As he and I were walking down the hallway to my place, Karen was just getting out of hers. She saw Dean and I smiling and talking and his arm around my waist and approached me, asking angrily if I was  being "" a whore and selling my body"".  I told her she was insane and asked her to kindly fuck off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Later that day, I received a call from the property manager. She wanted to let me know that Karen and Todd had complained that I was  "" a prostitute""  and that it was dangerous for their children to be in the same building as me. They told her in great detail about how I was bringing home different men. The property manager had gotten to know Brian and Derek quite well and had and inkling that I was friends with them. So she contacted them and they told her all about the EP's crazy behavior and accusations and that the man they had seen me with was a mutual friend, there was no prostitution going on. The property manager dissuaded EP from filing any sort of false complaint against me as it could cause a world of trouble for them. I thanked that kind lady and later had a good chuckle over it all with Brian and Derek.

&#x200B;

The blatant harassment from Karen and Todd had stopped, but of course, the hateful looks continued. On one occasion, when we were in the elevator together, Karen tried made a pathetic attempt at shaming  me by condescendingly asking if I was going to have any men over that night. What she didn't realize is that shame about my promiscuity is something I'm entirely incapable of feeling. I proceeded to tell her in great detail about all the sex acts I was going to engage in that evening. I mean, she's the one who asked, right?

"Seeing the hype of Animal Crossing, I just want to warn potential buyers out there, don't buy because of hype, the game is not for everyone",8163,NintendoSwitch,1300,1583653869.0,"I have noticed the hype. Yes, it is a AAA game heavily advertised and recommended by AC community. I just want to warn those without any prior experience to AC, hold first before you buy.

Watch the game play video posted by the community, understand the nature of the game before you make that decision.

I once bought AC NL due to its high score on review sites. As a player new to this genre, I jumped on the boat, only to realize it is really not for someone like me.

Things to consider before the purchase:

Are you frustrated with things you CANNOT do on a particular day/time?

Are you the type of person who want to see results immediately? Or efforts paid off immediately?

Do you feel tired for repetitive tasks?

Do you prefer games with a lot of bosses and challenges that require your gaming skills?

&#x200B;

If you answer YES to all these questions, do seriously perform some research on the game before your purchase.

Note: I have nothing against AC, it is a great game for those who can appreciate it, just it may not for everyone

Edit: my first ever SILVER! Thank you kind stranger. I’m so happy.

I was hardly sleeping or eating, and I was pounding tons of energy drinks. I know that was stupid. Working so much was also stupid. I’m young and relatively healthy all things considered. I was sort of alone when it happened, and a co-worker found me sometime after I had passed out.

While I was in the hospital, no one came to see me. Friends or family. That really hurt, but I was only in the hospital for 4 or 5 days. A few friends said they would come see me, but never did. One friend even offered to take me to one of my follow up appointments, but blew me off to hang out with her friends. We ended up getting into a huge argument over it and don’t talk anymore. I’ve told most of my friends and family. Excluding my parents (who are biologically required to care) no one really seems to care or be concerned. I hate saying this cause it sounds super dramatic, but I actually could have died. I’ve been dealing with memory issues ever sense, and my doctor says the longer it goes on the more likely it is to be permanent.

I feel like I’m all alone now. I’m angry and upset at everyone, and I don’t know what to do from here? Do I just need to get over it?  I’m still dealing with memory issues which are super scary and I feel like I have no one to talk to.

TL:DR: I had a heart attack that has lead to some possibly life long issues and none of my friends or family cared.

EDIT: I wanna add a little more context around the actual heart attack. Basically, I have a day job (I work IT at my local school district) I was asked/offered to come help my father's company set up a brand new office. I 100% should have said no as it was way to much work on top of my already packed schedule, but I had just broken up with a girl and needed something to focus on (and it was just a super cool opportunity I didn't wanna pass up). Between my day job and this project I had no free time, was getting like 4 hours of sleep if I was lucky, and just drinking tons of caffeine/energy drinks and not eating. 3ish weeks of this was too much for my body to handle. I'm generally not crazy overworked. I just took on a 2nd job/project that I really shouldn't have. Had I not done that, I'm positive I wouldn't be in this situation. The project was meant to last about 2 months, maybe less. ",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ff47rf/i_26m_had_a_heart_attack_and_no_one_cared_not/,2020-03-08 02:14:33

"An underrated feeling, is when someone asks a question about something random, and you’re able to provide a detailed and educated answer",6954,CasualConversation,332,1583665279.0,"My friend randomly mentioned horseshoes the other day and how they seemed cruel, and I was quickly able to change their mind by explaining how the nails actually go into the hoof of the foot and not the meat—so no pain—as well as it protects the horse’s hoof and offers better traction on a larger array of surfaces which is helpful in nearly all sport riding.

I also got to explain why bodies are generally buried 6 feet deep recently.

Edit because people are too lazy to look at the comments: They actually technically aren’t, but technically are! In 1665 it was thought that burying the bodies 6 feet deep would somehow help limit the spread of disease. In reality, the hole is 6ft deep, but then the coffin is put inside and (in a modern cemetery) there is often a concrete vault aligned overtop to avoid the coffin caving in. At this point there is about 3 feet of space left in which is filled with dirt. So, 3-6feet is a more accurate burial description

When’s the last time you got to explain knowledge like that?",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ff6e69/an_underrated_feeling_is_when_someone_asks_a/,2020-03-08 05:01:19

To my right-wing Evangelical Christian friend who came out as transgender:,6771,LeopardsAteMyFace,471,1583655733.0,"I'm sorry you lost your job when your company terminated you without cause when you came out.

I'm sorry you lost your home in the divorce when the court basically awarded everything to your wife.

I'm sorry you lost your church community when you both claimed to be the most inclusive, welcoming people.

I'm sorry you lost your wife when she basically immediately abandoned you and divorced you.

I'm sorry you lost your children when they ghosted you completely because they had been programmed from birth to despise LGBT people.

I'm sorry you lost your friends who said they would stand by you through anything which was clearly a lie.

I'm sorry you lost your family, who you knew never truly loved you.

And I'm sorry it's taken you years of constantly vilifying liberals as intolerant bigots, and then ended up jobless, homeless, and nearly totally alone until the LGBT community took you in and basically saved you from dying to realize that no one around you really loved you.
