UPDATE - Kid put stuff in yard; ran over it with mower; mother wants me to pay.,63018,legaladvice,3,1583740171.0,"Thought I’d update you all since so many people offered advice in the original post yesterday.

Brief summary of what happened: Neighborhood kid left his phone in my grass while I was mowing and I mowed it by mistake. The mother got upset and demanded I pay for it.

Well she(mother) and son showed up at my door around noon and apologized. She said that she misunderstood what happened and thought that I’d done it on purpose to teach her son a lesson about leaving his stuff in my yard. I guess he explained to her it was his fault which I thought was commendable for someone his age. She told me that she just stressed about it because she is a single mother and doesn’t really have the means to replace it at the moment and that if it was anything else she probably wouldn’t have gotten so upset but he likes hanging out with other kids and that’s how she keeps track of him.

I told her about my spare phone (iPhone 7 his was a 6s). I also took the advice of some of the commenters that it might be damaging to just give it to him and that I should perhaps have him work for it. I have a detached garage and have been needing to clean it and told her if he wanted to help me I’d give him the phone.

He instantly looked excited, I imagine he felt like he’d never get a new phone, and she acted very grateful and said he could help.

Left and came back an hour later, just the son this time and we got started cleaning. Took about 4 hours, a lot of work but nothing too hard (he's just 12)

I had a couple cords of firewood I wanted moved out and stacked into a rack and then a bunch of boxes I cut up and had him bag and carry to the curb, he swept, had a coke and a couple slices of pizza then got his phone.

I had a talk with him about paying attention to his where his things are because it won’t always work out like this.

I also told him if he wants to mow my yard every weekend and his mom says he can I’ll pay him $30 a week. (It will probably take him a couple hours) 

He again acted excited at the thought of making money and when I asked him what he’d spend it on he said games. We figured out new games would be about $60 and worked it out that I’d pay him $20 for 3 weeks then $65 on the fourth week so he could cover tax because it might be hard for him to save. The fourth week he will do an extra little chore to cover the five bucks, like sweep off the porch or walkway.

I hope I’ve done the right thing and didn’t make him think that everything just works out but I did my best to have him earn it. And hopefully showed an equal measure of kindness that he will carry with him. I also didn’t want the mother to stress over replacing the phone as my mom was also a single mother and I know how tough it can be. My own son is just 2 so it was my first real opportunity to pass on some fatherly wisdom, which I hope is what I did.

Thanks for your input everyone. I really appreciate it.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fflk2l/update_kid_put_stuff_in_yard_ran_over_it_with/,2020-03-09 02:49:31

tifu by masturbating to what sounded like 2 people having sex.,33834,tifu,898,1583756112.0,"tldr at end

I live in a small apartment building in the middle of the city. Even though living directly in the city, the area tends to be really quiet. 

I come home from work, eat whilst watching TV and slowly make myself hover to my beloved bed.
The urge of jerking off has been there all day, i just ignored it for today tho. Everything was quiet when i heard the first few things starting to bang against the other side of my wall. Thinking nothing of it i slowly drift off into sleep when suddenly, WHAM another strike hits. This time louder and more shaky.
I hear silent “moans” and loud “humping”. 
We just recently got new neighbors, a young couple mid 20s. 

As already mentioned, the urge to whack it was there all day, so i did what any man would do: i start jerking off to what i believe are sex sounds.

Time goes on and the noises are getting louder and louder.
Right as i finish i hear a loud *THOMB* like somebody just hit the floor.
In shook, heartrate at around 200bpm, i sit there.
I stare into the emptiness of my room.

Sitting there for what felt like years, was only 1 minute.
Slowly i get myself together and start cleaning up.
No new noise has since been heard.

Done with everything i lay in bed once again, this time ready for sleep.

That’s when i hear a loud *KNOCK KNOCK* from the other apartments door.

“Police, please open the door” 

The door opens, the policemen swarm into the building.
The woman screaming, as she is being brought to the outside.
I look out the window 

1 Cop and 1 Ambulance car.

My thoughts as slowly realize i just did the do to a woman getting beaten up.

I feel bad now.
I could’ve helped.

This shit gon give me PTSD for sure.


tldr:
what sounded like 2 people having sex, turned out to be a man beating up his woman. which i accidentally beat my meat to.

EDIT:

changed: “flick it” to “whack it”.

EDIT 2:

well lol this kinda blew up.
so thanks for the gold and these other awards.
still in shock tho

EDIT 3:

a lot of people think this is fake / a copy pasta / stolen.
sadly it’s not. 
also i don’t know why people say “free karma”, i created the throwaway account especially for this instance. i’m never gonna use it again.

others think i’m a freak, like yeah alright. 
and you’re flawless, aye?",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ffp2oa/tifu_by_masturbating_to_what_sounded_like_2/,2020-03-09 07:15:12

(Update): I(F24) went on a girls trip and ended up heavily making out with one of my friends (F23). Now I can't stop thinking about it and don't know what she thought of it.,11053,relationship_advice,377,1583784426.0,"**Summary of previous post:** [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fddqag/if24_went_on_a_girls_trip_and_ended_up_heavily/) I went on a birthday trip with some friends. One friend (F23) and I kissed a few times (first was a joke), and it sparked my interest to try it again.

**Update:**

I messaged A after my previous post just saying how I was ready for the weekend. She messaged me back saying she missed me and I asked what she was doing this weekend. She told me she'd let me know what her day looked like and was being *semi* flirty, but I wasn't sure where we were at so I was on guard a bit. We messaged here and there all day, and she had a work event that night. She had a few drinks and said ""I wish I could meet up with you tonight"". I told her she could, but I didn't want a repeat of the trip and said I looked forward to seeing her Saturday though. (I think this may have given her the wrong impression and I will get back to that). The same thing happened Friday where we were both being a bit flirty. I sent her a picture with this flirty filter that said ""how many people have crushes on you: 0"" and she said ""I know at least one person that does"". So that gave me more confidence to not be so shy with her.

Then came Saturday! We went to brunch and it was great. We talked about the trip overall, but we never talked about what happened. Which, since it was in public I'm happy about because we had people way too close to get into all of that. But we just talked and it felt natural, even though I was incredibly nervous, and she kept making comments about how alike we are.

At the end we hugged goodbye and I could tell we both *wanted* to kiss, but neither of us initiated it. I was going to bring it up after I had driven home, but within two minutes of me sitting in my car and leaving, she messaged me saying she wanted really wished she had kissed me, but wasn't sure if I wanted to. I told her I did want to! We had a party that night but she wasn't sure if she was going to come, so I told her if she did, I promised to initiate it this time. Unfortunately she couldn't come, but we're going to meet for lunch this week. The rest of the weekend was a mix of flirty and just talking and it was really nice :)

I'm going to make sure we lay out what we're going for here before anything happens, but I'm very happy with where it is at now!

Thank you to everyone who gave this confused Redditor some great advice! This was completely out of my comfort zone and I'm glad I took that leap and messaged her first :)",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fftnp5/update_if24_went_on_a_girls_trip_and_ended_up/,2020-03-09 15:07:06

Just prevented suicide,10073,teenagers,442,1583739494.0,"So , there was this dude on discord that one time just randomly dm'ed me. He said something like ""I already ordered a gun"" or ""I'm done after 24 yrs of my miserable life""

I got so upset with his situation that I started talking with him.(keep in mind that I have never did something like that before, so I was just sweating like I was defusing a fcking bomb)

After a *3 days* of talking with him , he said he cancelled an order. I was so happy , I was thinking ""ok , now I just need to cheer him up"" that took another 3 hours. 
I found out that getting really personal with someone can really change someone. Sometimes too personal >.>

Now ,he came back to server we have met for the first time. He went offline , but I think I really changed his mind about that situation.

Now I'm just exploding with positive energy. I'm so happy that I have basically saved someone's life.

The coronavirus has taught me how important an emergency fund is,9649,personalfinance,596,1583770189.0,"I live in Korea and I have been heavily impacted by the coronavirus. No, I'm not sick, and even if I do 100% of my care will be free. I've always heard of emergency funds, and so forth. I've also always heard of preppers who spend lots of money stockpiling supplies to survive things like the coronavirus. Until recently Korea had the 2nd largest outbreak of the virus. Here are some of the many economic impacts it has had.

* Many businesses are shut down, especially bars and restaurants.  
* Many schools are shut down (especially private schools)
* Many large companies have shut down major parts of their operations

Some real impacts on my life

My income has been slashed due to a massive drop in workload. This effect was essentially immediate.  My income for the next few months is going be a fraction of what it normally is. And this is a direct result of the virus. There is nothing I can do to combat that.

My girlfriend is a teacher for a private school. Her school has shut down, the question on her income is up in the air at the moment. Her school isn't receiving tution fees from the students since they are no longer in operation, but we still got bills to pay. So does her school.

Now luckily for us, I literally completed funding my emergency fund in January after saving up for it, I'm laughing because chances are starting in April I'm going start taking money out of it to survive. This is with me drastically reducing what I spend. Some changes I've made

* Not driving anywhere so no parking/gas expenses
* Not going out for drinks or dinner
* No trips
* Not buying anything we don't need, those new pair of shoes? Yea they can wait
* Etc

Although we have spent some money, I recently got back into playing online poker I deposited $50 to keep my mind busy, I've also bought two new video games to take up time. My girlfriend ordered some art supplies and is painting a bunch. However those extra expenses are small compared to what we are saving.

Some other examples I've seen

**The Bar**

A friend of mine owns a bar, its pretty successful. Recently he did some renovations in preparing for the upcoming spring/summer. His bar is now closed. He had to close it to save money because so many people were staying home it was costing him more money then he was earning to stay open. However, he still has bills he has to pay. He has a mortgage on his home, he has rent on his bill, car payment, and all your other standard bills. He's done the math and if by Mid-April he's not able to open back up he may never have the money to open back up again

**The big spender friend**

I have a friend who has lived paycheck to paycheck and never saving. His company has shut down and put him on unpaid leave. He's not earning an income, has next to nothing in savings, and still has living expenses. He's had to go to a bank to get a loan to pay rent. FYI if this virus last long enough (it'd have to be about 6-7 months) I may also have to go get a loan to pay rent, but at least I don't have to do that yet.

You can still go to the store and buy all the food, water, etc what you need. The supply chains are still fully functional and shelves are pretty much stocked. No one is going hungry, but pretty soon people will be going broke. The Korean Govt has said they plan on giving out grants to small businesses, one major fear is that after the virus passes many small businesses (which are an important part of the economy here) will go out of business as soon as they open.

And this just really highlights the importance of an emergency fund.

And FYI my SO and I did some math, with the cut back on our expenses we should be able to survive up to 10-12 months with no income. You'd be amazed at how little money you spend watching netflix all day.

SO seriously folks, get your emergency fund going. I'm seeing people all around me freaking out over lack of financial capacity. And 2 weeks ago everything was normal.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ffrf5i/the_coronavirus_has_taught_me_how_important_an/,2020-03-09 11:09:49

"Apparently, I’m a free babysitting service",8458,entitledparents,258,1583745039.0,"I’ve been seeing an increase of Christian EPs so I thought I was add in one.  I grew up as a pastor’s kid and the amount of entitlement I’ve seen is astounding.  This story is one that first came to mind. 
People tend to see pastor’s kids as an extension of the church and not as real people so we would constantly have people taking advantage of us and my parents would make us go along with it.  

There was a lady that attended our church that had three small children aged 3-6.   I was about 15 years old.  The lady would often drop her kids off for ‘free babysitting’ at our house.  My parents would of course say it was fine and I would be stuck watching them.  One day she decided that she needed free babysitting and dropped them off without any extra clothes or anything.  The first day the youngest kid was sitting in my lap and threw up all over herself.  I gave her a bath and found a long shirt for her to wear while I washed her clothes.   That night Ep never showed up to pick up the kids.  So I put them to bed in my bed and slept on the floor the little girl peed my bed and her older sister informed me that she wasn’t potty trained and Ep had said that I would buy pull-ups for her.   I informed my mother who went out and got some.  Then all three kids started throwing up and had fevers.  We tried calling EP but she didn’t answer.  

The next day we managed to get ahold of EP who told me that she was not able to pick the kids up until the next day.  So I had three sick kids for two days.  She finally showed up the next afternoon and I told her the kids had been sick. 

EP”oh I know that is why I needed a babysitter their grandma said she wouldn’t watch them if they were sick and I needed a break.”

The next day I was home sick and EP showed up at my house and my parents weren’t home.  She tried dropping off her kids and I refused and told her I was home sick from school.  She replied that I should be able to watch her kids because I was home.  I refused. She then called my mother and tried convincing her that she needed me to watch them because she had a hair appointment.  My mother told her no because I was sick and would get them sick.  She responded saying that they were already sick and she didn’t have daycare so I should just stay home and watch them for a couple days until we were all better.   I shut the door in her face.  My mother never made me babysit for her again.",False,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/ffmnqm/apparently_im_a_free_babysitting_service/,2020-03-09 04:10:39

TIFU by raping a spider to death,11081,tifu,963,1583783977.0,"***This post is has some heavy NSFW elements to it so be warned.***

>""Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out ***against a person without that person's consent***""

This happened this morning so it's all pretty fresh.

So I'll be honest right off the bat: I have a cum rag which I use to masturbate.
I'm rather using this blanket because I don't like touching my junk while masturbating. I have very rough hands.

However, in this post I'll refrain from calling it a cum rag since it's kinda demeaning.
I shall call it the ""the cum blanket"" from now on.

It's this utterly soft blanket and when it's on my dick it's just the best feeling. 
Is it better than a vagina? Not really. But it does the job.

I live together with my girlfriend so letting the cum blanket just laying around wouldn't be wise.
She knows I masturbate (she does it too, duh) but she doesn't know that I do it with a cum blanket.

So after I masturbate I take the cum blanket and put it under my side of our shared bed.
She never looks under there and even if she did, she wouldn't see all the stains because
after I'm done I gently roll the cum blanket up so all the sperm is on the inside of the cum blanket roll.
She never touches or even acknowledges it so I'm in the clear.

So anyways my girlfriend is currently home sick and she's staying up all night recently.
Today, when I woke up for work around 5am she was still up. I could hear her talking to friends online
in her office next to our bedroom.

I don't really know why but I got extremely horny all the sudden. I had a look at my alarm clock
and I still had about 10 minutes to spare and my GF was still busy. So I took my cum blanket and got ready for a good time.

I placed a soft part of the cum blanket over my dick and got my phone. I put in some ear plugs and loaded
up some nice porn (because why not).

While I was searching for a good video I felt this weird tingling sensation around the shaft region of my dick.
It felt kinda weird so I wanted to check but the second the tingling started I found a nice video.

The tingling also stopped so I didn't bother any further.

I fapped for about 7 minutes. It felt pretty nice if that's worth something.

After I ~~unleashed my load~~ was done I'd do the usual routine. I'd have a look at the mess down there;
to see what I had to clean up with my cum blanket. 

But when I turned my nightstand lamp on and had a look down there I just couldn't believe what I saw.
I almost couldn't make it out, my eyes were still adjusting but I was horrified.

In the midst of all the cum was a gigantic spider; or rather what was left of it.
It was fucking disgusting, it was this green/yellow-ish slime mixed with cum.
Remains of an utterly dismembered arachnid, that poor thing.
You could make out it's upper torso and some legs. Jesus, the hairs man. They were everywhere.
How do these things have so many hairs??? And the legs, they were the only thing that was remotely intact.

I don't know how it got in my rolled up cum blanket, it must've thought it'd make a great home or something.
Maybe it was just looking for protection. Oh dear god.

And it wasn't just some regular house spider. It was a huge, HUGE motherfucking monster.
Turns out that tingling feeling was probably the spider trying to escape it's impending doom.

The thing was almost as big as the palm of my hand. At least that's what I could make out by looking at it's dismembered remains.

I felt so terrible about what I had done. I instantly rushed to the bathroom with my cum blanket and cleansed it of all spider remains.

I just can't get that out of my head, that poor animal on my dick getting crushed, torn apart and then soaked in cum.

It didn't deserve to die like this. For all it's worth, I hope its life ended quick.

I hope the spider can forgive me. I didn't mean to.. I'm sorry.

Anyways, thank you so much for reading. I just had to let this out.

***TL;DR: I got real horny and didn't realize I was raping an innocent spider (which was hiding in my cum rag) to death. May it rest in peace.***

***EDIT:***  Here's some minor details people have been asking for:

- I live in Germany

- That's the spider species: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_house_spider

- The cum blanket get's cleaned on a weekly basis (I fap like 2 times a week so chill out)

Last night, I was putting him to bed and he said his little prayer out loud where he thanked God for his mom, dad, sister, dog, and me. I’m really not religious at all but I got a little bit choked up after that. It was such a pure, innocent moment and I just felt such love toward the little guy.

I hate that rainbows have been turned into Gay Pride symbols...,6328,unpopularopinion,1349,1583743335.0,"I hate that rainbows have been turned into Gay Pride symbols, and I especially hate that the Babadook, a fictional horror character from one of the best horror films out there, was also swallowed up into an LBGTQ symbol. For the latter, a dildo was even produced, "" The Babadong"".

Isn't that great? I'm sure producer Jennifer Kent is thrilled to have a dildo associated with her first project! /s

Rainbows are a beautiful natural phenomenon. They used to belong to everyone. But now? Not so much...

The Bababdook movie is SO far removed from anything even remotely LBGTQ related, that a category error by Netfix  should not have resulted in a masterpiece being  pigeonholed.

I realize my opinion will probably be one the more down-voted Unpopular opinions,(I've noticed you  can't be too ""unpopular"" lmao!),  but it's been a long day and I'm too tired to gaf.
