This is a backup of my research. I needed to store it somewhere. 
It serves as a historic record of US-based Reddit traffic.
Please do not use this information for evil.
There is a surprising level of power contained in these findings.

Abstract: 

Brandon Grisham
Analyzing and Predicting Trends with Public Data from Online Communities

Reddit has become one of the largest social news forums in the world, 
featuring an average of 430 million active users and 21 billion views per month (RedditInc Press, 2019). 
A key question is how businesses and academia can effectively use the public information provided by 
Reddit’s organized communities to explore salient interesting research questions. Given the scope 
of Reddit’s 130 thousand ‘subreddits’, difficulties arise from the lack of collection tools that can
analyze user opinions, posted questions, or shared perspectives. This research utilizes a 
personally-created program that collects daily traffic data from the entire website, scraping various
parameters like subscriber growth and post frequency into a keyword-driven database. The API-programmed
script also populates our database with details regarding specific communities, highlighting areas of 
interest for businesses and academia alike. By utilizing this database system, one can locate and chart
growing or diminishing trends among Internet users. An example of one of these trends include correlating
data resulting from the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Clear patterns emerge between the subscriber 
growth of the Coronavirus subreddit, a rise in the posts regarding the Coronavirus on numerous investment
subreddits, and the impact the virus has made on the U.S. stock market. The ultimate goal of this research
is to leverage statistical data analysis and machine-learning techniques to capitalize on this dataset. 
This research will help illuminate Internet user interests, predict rising and falling trends, and chart
the current popularity of cultural phenomena.
